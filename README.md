# Caterpillar Logic Solutions
Solutions for the game Caterpillar Logic.

Level | Solution
--- | --- 
1 | Valid sequences are palindromic, ie the same when reversed
2 | The first and last colors can't be the same
3 | Must contain green
4 | Can't contain both red and gray
5 | Must contain exactly three distinct colors
6 | Must contain exactly three red cells
7 | Must contain gray, and more gray cells than blue blocks
8 | Can't have red and purple touching anywhere in the sequence
9 | Must have five combined red and gray cells
10 | Can't contain any blocks of length one, and must contain a block of length 2
11 | Must have exactly four blocks of any length and color
12 | Must have exactly two green blocks of any length 
13 | Must have exactly two blocks of length 2
14 | There must be at least one block of length 2
15 | All blocks of length _n_ must be adjacent, and the different block lengths must be in increasing or decreasing order. For example, RGBBWWW is valid (1,1; 2, 3) but RGBBBWW is not (1,1; 3, 2).
16 | One color can't appear more than any other color unless it's the only color in the sequence
17 | The longest block length must only appear once
18 | There must be exactly three distinct block types. For example, if a red block of length 1 appears three times, only count it once. However, a red block of length 1 and a red block of length 2 are two distinct block types
19 | The shortest block length must only appear once
20 | Cannot have two separate blocks of the same color and length
